# Introduction
Everything here is made for the purpose of learning. This is still work in progress and there is absolutely no warranty that it will work. In fact it will not work almost certainly but if you are willing to give it a try then ill gladly help you.

As of now only event schema is supported. Im working on a object schema where a single document covers the whole email flow. This will allow to answer joined questions like "Top20 accept ip countries with spam verdicts"

SETUP:
1. install ELK - tested on 6.3.2 and 6.4
2. configure rsyslog:
local1.*                                                /var/log/smg.log
:msg, contains, "Sending response"
local2.*                                                /var/log/cas.log
3. configure SMG according to "Symantec Messaging Gateway -Â Log Settings.png" from install_images folder.
4. configure CAS according to "Content Analysis System - *.png" from install_images folder.
5. use the files from etc_logstash to configure logstash
6. use kibana_saved_objects.json to import Kibana visualizations and dashboard.

Done.

Notes:
1. if you dont want to use syslog and have a bunch of log files that you want to parse you will have to adjust both patterns for smg and cas accordingly. Bare SMG and CAS logs don't have syslog fields!
2. keep the time synchronised! Index patterns use CAS and smg local time as Tile Filter field but its still a best practice to have the time synced.
